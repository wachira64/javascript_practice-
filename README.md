A daily JavaScript learning project exploring core programming concepts and data structures. Each day adds a new script covering topics like variables, scope, Big-O, arrays, objects, classes, recursion, stacks, queues, and more, with hands-on examples and practice.
 JavaScript Data Structures Playground

This is my personal learning project while studying **JavaScript** and **Data Structures & Algorithms** using the books:
- *Exploring JS*
- *JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms*

Goal
To practice coding daily by building small scripts that focus on one concept at a time:
- Variables, scope, and Big-O
- Arrays and loops
- Objects, strings, stacks & queues
- Linked lists and recursion
- Classes and OOP
- Sorting, searching, and more advanced algorithms

Structure
Each day I add a new script file:
